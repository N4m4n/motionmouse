An openCV project made by Sarthak and Naman.

The application has to be first calibrated using the mask added. The user has to adjust the sliders so as to correctly identify the object (by its colour). To do this:

1) Make sure you are in a well-lit room
2) Now choose an object whose colour is distinct from the other objects in the background.
3) Adjust the sliders in a way such that the chosen object appears white while the background appears black
4) Now uncomment the line as mentioned in the code and run the program again. You will that your mouse moves along your object.
5)To exit, press "q".
